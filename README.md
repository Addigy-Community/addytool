# addytool: An API Wrapper for Addigy

`addytool` has the capacity to do great harm to your Addigy environment. You are responsible for your own actions!

To more easily leverage Addigy's API, `addytool` abstracts the details of the API to allow admins to treat endpoints as Python objects.

`addytool` is still in beta, and there's no guarantee of backwards compatibility with future releases.

## Requirements
Install `addytool` using `pip`.

To get `pip`, run `sudo easy_install pip`.

Then...
`pip install --user addytool`
